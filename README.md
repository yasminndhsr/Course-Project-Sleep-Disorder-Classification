# Course-Project-Sleep-Disorder-Classification
Classification of sleep disorders using K-Nearest Neighbors with lifestyle-based features and SMOTE.
# 📌 Overview
This project presents a machine learning model built with the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm to classify sleep disorders such as Insomnia and Sleep Apnea, using features derived from lifestyle, mental, and physical health conditions. It utilizes the Sleep Health and Lifestyle Dataset from Kaggle and applies the SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique) to handle class imbalance.
# 🔬 Objectives
Classify sleep disorders into 3 categories: None, Insomnia, and Sleep Apnea.

Evaluate the impact of SMOTE on improving classification performance.

Determine the optimal value of K using the Elbow Method.
